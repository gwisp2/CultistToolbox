# CultistToolbox

A plugin for the Mansions of Madness boardgame companion app.

### Requirements

[ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) is strongly recommended. It adds possibility to configure mod settings in the UI.

### Features

1. Fine-tuning your collection. You may enable investigators from an expansion but disable tiles and items.  
   Press F1 (ConfigurationManager is required) to enable/disable different expansion components. 
2. Choose any scenario variant instead of a random one
3. Show expansion icon when showing a name (for monsters and items). Searching for items and monsters becomes easier.
4. Cheating. You don't have to use these unless you want to. Press F6 to open/close cheating menu.
   - skip puzzles
   - jump to any available cutscene
   - predict future scenario events (quite buggy now)
   - show the full list of tiles and non-random items
